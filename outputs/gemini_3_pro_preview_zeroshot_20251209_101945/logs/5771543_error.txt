Prompt:\nYou are extracting pairwise ICO results from a randomized controlled trial.  
Return only JSON of the form: {"extractions":[ ... ]}.

Each item in "extractions" is one ICO row with exactly these fields (use null for missing/not in article/not applicable):

{
  "outcome": "<STRING>",
  "intervention": "<STRING>",
  "comparator": "<STRING>",
  "outcome_type": "<continuous | binary>",
  "intervention_events": <int>,
  "intervention_group_size": <int>,
  "comparator_events": <int>,
  "comparator_group_size": <int>,
  "intervention_mean": <int>,
  "intervention_standard_deviation": <int>,
  "comparator_mean": <int>,
  "comparator_standard_deviation": <int>
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED ICO TRIPLETS (MUST NOT BE ALTERED)

The ICO triplets provided in ico list: - CGI-I response rate (Intervention: fluoxetine vs Comparator: placebo)
- CGI-I response rate (Intervention: desvenlafaxine vs Comparator: placebo)
- Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (Intervention: desvenlafaxine vs Comparator: placebo)
- Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (Intervention: fluoxetine vs Comparator: placebo) are fixed and authoritative. You must:

- use them exactly as written in the JSON output,
- never modify their wording,
- never expand, merge, split, or normalize them,
- never create ANY new ICO triplets,
- never change intervention, comparator, or outcome names,
- never infer additional outcomes or arms from the text.

If the study reports similar or related outcomes, ignore them unless they match an ICO triplet exactly in meaning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SEMANTIC MATCHING RULE (CRITICAL)

Although the ICO triplets in ico_list must be used *exactly as written* in the JSON output:

You MUST match interventions, comparators, and outcomes in the article *semantically*, not textually.

This means:

- The article may use synonyms, abbreviations, paraphrases, or group labels (“treatment arm”, “control group”, “usual care”, “placebo”, “FPG”, “blood glucose after fasting”, etc.).
- The intervention/comparator/outcome in ico_list may NOT appear verbatim in the text.
- You must identify equivalents based on clinical meaning, not wording.
- Do NOT require exact string matches.
- Use the ico_list names only in the output, not as literal search patterns.

Failing to find verbatim matches does NOT mean the ICO is absent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
STRICT ITERATION LOGIC (ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED)

Treat ico_list as the complete and final set of ICO triplets.

For each ICO triplet (in order):

1. Search the article ONLY for information corresponding to that ICO (based on semantic meaning).

2. If at least one numeric value exists → produce exactly one JSON object for that triplet and populate the numeric fields.

3. If no numeric values exist → produce one JSON object with all numeric fields set to null.

4. Continuous outcomes:
   - explicitly search for group sizes, mean, and standard deviation for each arm,
   - fill them if reported,
   - null is allowed only if the PDF omits the value.

5. DO NOT generate any extraction for outcomes or arms not in ico_list.

6. The final JSON must contain no more than equal to the length of ico_list objects.

7. If zero objects are produced, still return: {"extractions": []}.

You may not scan the article for outcomes outside ico_list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRACTION RULES

Continuous outcomes (when explicitly reported):
- intervention_group_size
- comparator_group_size
- intervention_mean
- comparator_mean
- intervention_standard_deviation
- comparator_standard_deviation

Binary outcomes (when explicitly reported):
- intervention_group_size
- comparator_group_size
- intervention_events
- comparator_events
- numeric rates if reported

---------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL RULES

- Use plain numbers (no %, no units).
- Missing values → null.
- Output must be raw valid JSON.
- No narrative text.
- No comments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
ICO UNIQUENESS (CRITICAL)

Exactly one JSON extraction per ICO triplet.

If multiple values exist → choose the most precise or the value from the main Results section.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMEPOINT RULE

- If the ICO triplet specifies a timepoint → use only that timepoint.
- If not:
  - prefer post-intervention values,
  - if multiple exist, choose the latest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL RULE

Output NO ICO triplets other than those in ico_list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
