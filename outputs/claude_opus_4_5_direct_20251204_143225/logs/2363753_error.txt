You are extracting **pairwise ICO results** from a randomized controlled trial.  
Return **only** JSON of the form: `{"extractions":[ ... ]}`.

Each item in "extractions" is one ICO row with EXACTLY these fields (use null for missing/not applicable):

{
  "id": null,
  "evidence_inference_prompt_id": null,
  "pmcid": "<STRING OR INTEGER>",
  "outcome": "<STRING>",
  "intervention": "<STRING>",
  "comparator": "<STRING>",
  "outcome_type": "<continuous | binary>",
  "intervention_events": null,
  "intervention_group_size": null,
  "comparator_events": null,
  "comparator_group_size": null,
  "intervention_mean": null,
  "intervention_standard_deviation": null,
  "comparator_mean": null,
  "comparator_standard_deviation": null
}

## What to extract

You are given a list of target ICO triplets:

{ico_list}

Each triplet is `(Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)` (optionally with extra disambiguators like Timepoint/Population).

For **each such ICO triplet, and only these**:

- If the outcome is continuous, fill the mean/SD/group sizes when explicitly reported; leave other fields null.
- If the outcome is binary, fill events/group sizes (and rates if explicitly reported); leave other fields null.

## Rules

- One JSON object per ICO triplet with at least one reported numeric value; omit triplets with no reported values.
- Use plain numbers (no percent signs, no units).
- Do not invent or derive numbers; use only what is explicitly stated in Abstract/Results.
- Output raw JSON only (no markdown fencing, no extra text).

## ICO uniqueness (critical)

You must produce **at most one** JSON extraction per ICO triplet as defined in `{ico_list}`.

A valid ICO extraction is uniquely identified by the tuple:

  (intervention, comparator, outcome, and any additional disambiguators such as Timepoint or Population)

If two potential extractions share the same values for all of these fields, they are considered **identical ICOs**, even if:

- the text mentions the numbers multiple times,
- the numbers are formatted differently,
- the numbers appear in different sections.

In such cases, **output only ONE extraction** and ignore all duplicates.

You may output additional ICO extractions **only** if at least one of these fields differs:

- intervention  
- comparator  
- outcome  
- an explicit disambiguator (e.g., Timepoint = baseline vs week 12)

If none of these fields differ, **do not create another extraction**.
