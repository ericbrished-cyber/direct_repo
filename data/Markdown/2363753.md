**Summary** This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high-dose chemotherapy (HD-VIC) plus autologous bone marrow
transplant (HDCT) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol-derivate amifostine. Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both
treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine
(910 mg/m [2] at day 1–3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT
consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m [2/] d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m [2] /d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m [2] /d) all given for
3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 µg kg [�] [1 ] subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after
treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and
infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min [�] [1] ) and 37%
in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min [�] [1] ) (P < 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and
low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25% without versus 0% of patients with amifostine (P =
0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic
prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the
control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (> 500 µl [�] [1) ] and thrombocytes (> 25 000 µl [�] [1) ] were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12,
respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital
stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for
supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment
costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized
pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally,
a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT
are planned. Larger randomized trials evaluating amifostine cytoprotection during high-dose chemotherapy are warranted. © 2001 Cancer

High-dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoetic stem cell
transplantation (HDCT) has been used in selected patients with
chemosensitive solid tumours and haematologic neoplasms.
Randomized trials have indicated an improved outcome with
HDCT in comparison to standard treatment in patients with
relapsed high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, advanced multiple
myeloma, and acute myelogenous leukaemia after remission
induction without allogenic bone marrow donor (Philip et al, 1995;
Zittoun et al, 1995; Attal et al, 1996). The role of HDCT is
currently investigated in poor-risk high-grade non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (Gianni et al, 1997a; Haioun et al, 1997), relapsed
Hodgkin’s disease (Linch et al, 1993), breast (Gianni et al, 1997b;
Rizzieri et al, 1999) and ovarian cancer, SCLC as well as ‘poor
prognosis’ or relapsed germ cell tumours (Siegert et al, 1994;
Savarese et al, 1997; Hartmann et al, 1999a). The combination of

high-dose carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide has been developed as an active regimen for a variety of malignancies (Wright et
al, 1995; Beyer et al, 1997).
Amifostine, WR-2721, an organic thiophosphate cytoprotective
agent, is a prodrug which is dephosphorylated to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by tissue-bound alkaline phosphatase. WR-1065
acts via different mechanisms including radical scavening, hydrogene donation and in the case of platinum compounds, prevention
or reversal of platinum-DNA adducts. HDCT regimen containing
carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide is associated with multiple
side effects such as haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities,
e.g. acute nephrotoxicity and mucosal damage (Siegert et al, 1994;
Elias et al, 1995; Wright et al, 1995; Beyer et al, 1997). The
rationale for the use of amifostine in a controlled clinical trial in

patients receiving HDCT is based on the exclusion of a significant
pharmacokinetic interaction between amifostine and cytostatics

(Treskes and van der Vijgh, 1993; Gelmon et al, 1999), and the
evidence of its broad spectrum cytoprotective properties resulting
in a reduction of both haematologic and organ toxicities without
tumour protection (Kemp et al, 1996; Elias et al, 2000; Hartmann
et al, 2000a, 2000b). Preservation of renal function using the
combination of cisplatin, ifosfamide and etoposide plus amifostine
had been previously demonstrated (Hartmann et al, 1999b). Based
on this background a randomized pilot study was conducted to
evaluate the degree of side effects during HDCT and its possible
prevention by amifostine in patients with solid tumours. In-patient
costs for both treatment arms were compared in detail.


MATERIAL AND METHODS


**Inclusion and exclusion criteria**


Criteria for inclusion were required as follows: ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, adequate bone marrow function (WBC-count
� 4000 µl [�][1],platelet-count ≥ 100 000µl [�][1 ] and granulocyte count ≥
2000 µl [�][1] ), adequate renal (serum creatinine concentration
≤ 1.2 mg dl [�][1 ] and creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml min [�][1] ) and liver
function (bilirubin level ≤ 2.0 mg dl [�][1], and AST and ALT ≤ 3
times normal). Parameters for ineligibility included presence of
brain metastases, symptoms of ischaemic heart disease, and
history of congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within
the immediate preceding 6 months and/or clinically significant
arrhythmia.
Patients had given informed consent both for the treatment with
HD-VIC and for the randomization to pretreatment with or
without amifostine. Patients were stratified according to the
absence or presence of prior chemotherapy. This study had been
approved by the local University ethical committee.


**Treatment schedule**


All patients were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy
plus PBSC transplant and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) support either with or without amifostine pretreatment
during HDCT as outlined in Table 1. HDCT consisted of an simultaneous 18 h infusion of carboplatin 500 mg/m [2] /d and ifosfamide
4 g/m [2] /d preceded by a 4 h infusion of etoposide 500 mg/m [2] /d,
all applied on three consecutive days (Fetscher et al, 1999).

ml NaCl 0.9%. [d] Continued for 12 hours after the end of infusion.



Antiemetic prophylaxis consisted of 5-HT3-antagonists and
dexamethasone (20 mg i.v.) administrated 30 minutes prior to
chemotherapy application. Dexamethasone 4 mg was repeated at 4
and 12 hours after the start of chemotherapy. Patients treated with
amifostine additionally received 10 mg trifluorpromazine intravenously at each day of treatment. All patients received autologous PBSC transplantation two days after HDCT and G-CSF at a
dose of 5 µg kg [�][1 ] body weight as a subcutaneously injection
starting at day +5 until the granulocyte count was >5000 µl [�][1]

(Table 1). Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoetic recovery, frequency of
fever/infections, and days spent in hospital. All patients underwent
daily blood counts, serum electrolytes and creatinine measurements and a careful clinical examination. Creatinine clearance was

measured immediately before and at day 10 after the application of
HDCT. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment (none
versus ≥ 1 chemotherapeutic regimen/s) and the number of reinfused PBSC (<2.9 or ≥ 3.0 � 10 [6] CD34+ cells/kg body weight).


**Supportive treatment**


All patients received ofloxacin 200 mg orally twice daily and
fluconazol 100 mg orally daily as antibacterial and antifungal
prophylaxis starting at the day of treatment and continued unless
intravenous antibiotic treatment was required in case of fever.
Empiric combination treatment of a double-lactam penicilline and
an aminoglycoside antibiotic was started when temperatures
exceed 38.5˚C. The antibiotic regimen was modified according to
microbiologic findings and clinical requirements. Patients were
not nursed in reverse-barrier isolation. Total parenteral nutrition
was given during periods of inadequate oral calorie intake.
Following HD-VIC it was routine practice to transfuse red blood
cell concentrates to maintain haemoglobin-levels higher
than 8 g dl [�][1 ] and platelet concentrates to maintain platelet count
≥ 15 000 l [�][1. ]


**Application of amifostine**


Amifostine was applied at 910 mg/m [2] as a 15-min intravenous
infusion completed 15 min before the start of the simultaneous
carboplatin and ifosfamide infusion at each of the three consecutive days of treatment. Blood pressure was monitored every 5
min during the amifostine infusion. Amifostine was interrupted
in case of a >20 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure
depending on the patients baseline blood pressure level. Antihypertensive medication was withheld within 24 hours after amifostine administration.


**Urine sample collection and measurement of urinary**
**marker excretion**


Urine samples were collected immediately prior to HDCT

�
(day 1) and on days 3, 5 and 10 after HDCT. Parameters of
glomerular and tubular renal function such as total protein, albumine fraction, low molecular weight proteins (LMW), high molecular weight proteins (HMW), α 1-microglobulin and N-acetyl- β [2]

glucosaminidase (NAG) were determined from the urinary
samples as described earlier (Hartmann et al, 2000b). Ratios
for creatinine clearance (Ccreatinine) were calculated using the
general clearance formula for a substance y: clearancey =
([urine]y/[plasma]y) � urine volume.

**Measurement of toxicity**


Except for nephrotoxicity which was also characterized by the
measurement of creatinine clearance and the degree of urinary
protein excretion, side effects of treatment were classified
according to WHO toxicity scale. In order to minimize observation
bias the degree of toxicity of the gastrointestinal tract, such as
nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and diarrhoea, was judged by the
same person during the study period. For statistical calculation the
highest toxicity degree occurring during HDCT was used to
compare the both study arms.


**Calculation of treatment costs**


Detailed financial accounts of charges for each patient included
into the study were reviewed from the beginning of chemotherapy
until discharge. Charges were converted from German marks
(DEM) to Euro (Euro 1 = DEM 1.95). The cost analysis was based
on average wholesale price for each resource in Germany. Prices
for alimentation and transfusions were obtained from the billing
records of the University Medical Center Tübingen. The economic
calculation was performed on the basis of direct medical costs
(including drugs, costs of hospitalization, diagnostic radiology,
labaratory tests, cultures, pharmacy, blood products) from a third
party payer perspective from the start of treatment to discharge
(Eisenberg, 1989; Russel et al, 1996). However, the costs for
nursing and professional time as well as monitoring devices
associated with care for severely ill patients were not considered
separately because these costs are included in the costs of hospitalization in the German health system. Indirect costs, f.e. decreased
work productivity, or costs savings due to a different degree of late
side effects were also not considered in the analysis. Patients were
discharged in case of independence from platelet transfusions
defined as a thrombocyte count >25 000 µl [�][1 ] on two consecutive
days and recovery of neutrophil >1500 µl [�][1], absence of fever and
complete recovery from other grade III/IV toxicity.


**Statistics**


Non-parametric parameters of haematologic, renal, gastrointestinal toxicity as well as changes in the excretion rate of urinary
analytes were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-Test.
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 6.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA). Significance was defined as _P_ ≤ 0.05. All reported _P_
values were two-sided. Friedman-Oneway-ANOVA procedures
were applied in the follow-up of arms to evaluate whether the variance of the excretion rates of the urinary analytes was influenced
by the time point of collection.


RESULTS


**Patients’ characteristics**


40 consecutive patients receiving HD-VIC plus autologous PBSC
transplantation for different solid tumours between August 1997
and January 1999 were enrolled into the study and were followed
from start of treatment until discharge. Patients’ characteristics are
listed in Table 2. Patients in both arms were comparable in terms
of pretreatment due to stratification. Of 40 patients randomized
either to the amifostine arm or to the control arm, 26 (65%) had
received no previous chemotherapy except for two cycles of
induction chemotherapy (VIP-regimen consisting of etoposide,

HD-VIC therapy examined here (Fetscher et al, 1999). While 6
patients in the amifostine arm had previously treated with
chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin or ifosfamide, none
of the patients belonging to the control arm had received these
types of chemotherapy. The majority of patients had metastatic
breast cancer and had been treated with HDCT according to the
GEPDIS protocol (German Breast Cancer Dose Intensity Study).


**Nephrotoxicity**


All 40 patients were evaluable for serum creatinine, creatinine
clearance (GFR = glomerular filtration rate) and magnesium
values, and for urinary marker excretion analysis. Both arms had
received a comparable volume load of either saline or saline plus
glucose solution, as well as a comparable use of diuretics. No
differences existed in baseline parameters (day -1) between both
arms ( _P_ - 0.05) except for the magnesium serum and creatinine
serum concentrations both in favour of the control group ( _P_ = 0.02
and _P_ = 0.02). Patients treated with HD-VIC plus amifostine
revealed a significantly lower degree of renal damage compared to
the control arm. Following HDCT the median GFR values
decreased by 37% from 107 ml min [�][1 ] (63–196) at baseline to
67 ml min [�][1 ] (30–148) at day 10 in control patients. In contrast, in
the amifostine arm the GFR was almost completely preserved with
102 ml min [�][1 ] (60–149) prior to and 92 ml min [�][1 ] (51–133) after
application of chemotherapy ( _P_ < 0.01). 60% of patients treated
with HD-VIC alone had a GFR < 60 ml min [�][1 ] at day 10 after treatment compared to 20% of patients in the amifostine arm (Table 3).
The median decrease of serum magnesium levels was 8% in
patients with HD-VIC plus amifostine versus 17% in patients
without amifostine. However, the nadirs of Mg values were comparable due to different serum concentrations prior to the start of
chemotherapy between both treatment arms. Magnesium levels
have completely recovered in both groups at day 10 after treatment.
The determination of urinary markers revealed significant
nephrotoxic effects in both treatment arms. Protein excretion for
all fractions was increased about 20 to 35-fold by days 3 and 5 in
both arms. There were no signs of any pre- or post-renal causes
for these changes, such as e.g. haemorrhagic cystitis. An electrophoretic separation of the proteins excreted showed that the

excretion of all three protein fractions, HMW proteins, albumin
and LMW proteins, was significantly elevated following HDCT,
as well as α 1-microglobulin and NAG as markers of a proximal
tubular damage. The excretion of LMW proteins at day3 and albumine at days3,5,10 was significantly lower in the amifostine arm

arm ( _P_ = 0.02). Both arms have received additional treatment with
G-CSF s.c. Thrombocyte engraftment (> 25 000 µl [�][1] )was reached
at a median of two days earlier in the amifostine arm ( _P_ = 0.01).
However, patients in both groups needed platelet transfusions after
HD-VIC. The number of reinfused PBSC was comparable for both
arms (2.8 (range, 2.0–3.9) versus 3.0 � 10 [6] CD34+ cells µl [�][1]

(range, 2.2–7.8); _P_ = 0.3). The median number of days with fever

- 38.5˚C was 2 (range, 0–5) in amifostine pretreated patients
versus 4 days (range, 0–7) in control patients ( _P_ = 0.03) (Table 5).


**Gastrointestinal toxicity**


All patients had routinely received 5-HT3-receptor antagonists and
dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis. Patients treated with
amifostine additionally received 10 mg trifluorpromazine intravenously at each day of treatment (days 1–3). Some degree of
acute nausea shortly after or during the application of amifostine
was observed in all patients (see side effects of amifostine).
However, the proportion of patients with delayed nausea/vomiting
(defined as beyond 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy)
grade ≤ III was higher in the control arm resulting in a overall

(15%) and mydriasis (5%). Mild and asymptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in 80% of patients ( _n_ = 12/15 evaluable) in
the amifostine and 73% of patients in the control arm ( _n_ = 11/15
evaluable). The mean decrease of serum magnesium was 16%
(range, 9–26%) in the amifostine arm at day 4 (range, 3–10) and
13% (range, 4–24%) in the control patients at day 7 (range, 3–13).
All patients had routinely received intravenous calcium supplementation during treatment (see Table 1). There was no treatmentrelated mortality observed in both arms.


**In-patient cost calculation**


Pretreatment with amifostine resulted in a reduced use of antibi
otics, diagnostic radiology and cultures, platelet and red blood cell
transfusions, as well as of parenteral nutrition compared to control
patients. Despite a higher rate of acute nausea and emesis observed
immediately during or after the infusion of amifostine, an increased
frequency of delayed nausea and vomiting resulted in higher costs
for antiemetic medication in the control arm as stated before.

Patients treated with amifostine were discharged from hospital at
day 16 compared to day 18 in the control arm ( _P_ < 0.01). Therefore,
costs for laboratory and hospitalization were lower.
Overall costs for supportive care were Euro 63 063 (Euro 3153
per patient) in the amifostine arm versus Euro 87 931 (Euro 4396

per patient) in the control arm (not considering the additional costs
of the drug amifostine). Thus, savings of supportive care costs
in the amifostine arm were Euro 1243 per patient. Taking into
account the drug costs of amifostine (Euro 1783 per patient), treatment with amifostine resulted in additional costs of Euro 540 per
patient compared to the control arm (Table 7).


DISCUSSION


High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous peripheral
blood stem cell transplantation has been used for defined
subgroups of patients with chemosensitive malignancies. The
escalation of drugs such as etoposide and ifosfamide and the use of
high-dose carboplatin has become possible through the management of haematotoxicity with the availability of recombinant
haematopoietic growths factors and PBSC techniques. However,
with increased dosages of cytostatics non-haematologic organ
toxicities have become dose-limiting. Patients treated with regimens like HD-ICE/-VIC/-CEI containing carboplatin, ifosfamide
and etoposide are at risk for pronounced gastrointestinal toxicity,
infections, acute CNS toxicity and cognitive impairment (Siegert
et al, 1994; Elias et al, 1995; Wright et al, 1995; Beyer et al, 1997;
van Dam et al, 1998; Fetscher et al, 1999). Additionally, high dose
carboplatin, which is not nephrotoxic when applied in standard
doses and high-dose ifosfamide can produce significant renal
damage (Hartmann et al, 2000c; Wagstaff et al, 1989; van Dam et
al, 1998). The level of side effects may be pronounced particularly
in patients who have undergone intensive pretreatment. Thus, it is
important to evaluate methods to reduce these toxicities for regimens commonly used in the HDCT setting.
In clinical practice nephrotoxicity is measured via creatinine
serum values and the determination of the glomerular filtration
rate (GFR). The GFR measured by creatinine clearance is a more
sensitive parameter to detect glomerular damage compared to
serum creatinine values. In this study the GFR was clearly affected
in patients receiving HD-VIC without prior application of amifostine. Patients in the control arm had a median loss of GFR of 37%

compared to their baseline level after the application of the HDCT
cycle, and 35% of these patients had GFR values below 60 ml min [-1]

at day 10 after HDCT. This reduction of GFR may result in clinically relevant long-term effects particularly when further therapy
is required in the case of relapse, or when a second cycle of HDCT
is planned, or even when other nephrotoxic agents such as aminoglycoside antibiotics have to be used. Among patients receiving
amifostine during HD-VIC chemotherapy the GFR value dropped
only by a median of 10% and no patient developed GFR-values
below 60 ml min [�][1] at day 10. Nephroprotection was also demonstrated by a lower degree of urinary protein excretion–particularly
LMW proteins and albumine–compared to patients in the control
group. Magnesium and calcium supplementation were used during
the hydration period in both treatment arms, and therefore hypomagnesaemia or symptomatic hypocalcaemia were not a clinically
evident problem in both groups (Wadler et al, 1993). Although
hypocalcaemia was observed earlier in the time course after the
application of treatment in amifostine-pretreated patients (day 4
versus 7), the degree and frequency were comparable among both

arms.

The degree of nephrotoxicity in the HDCT setting with regimen
based on ifosfamide and high-dose carboplatin was not unexpected (Rosti et al, 1992; Barnett et al, 1993; Siegert et al, 1994;
Fields et al, 1995; Margolin et al, 1996; Fetscher et al, 1999).



Broun and coworkers (1991) have observed renal failure in 4 of 7
patients and gross haematuria in 2 patients. Siegert et al (1994)
reported a somewhat lower level of nephrotoxicity. This discrepancy may be explained by the different duration of ifosfamide
application. In the first trial (Broun et al, 1991) the drug was
applied as a short infusion over 30 minutes, whereas in the study
of Siegert et al (1994) it was administrated as continuous infusion
over 22 hours, thus avoiding high peak drug concentrations.
In an analysis of 150 consecutively treated patients with
relapsed germ cell tumours treated with HD-CEI (carboplatin
1500–2000 mg/m [2] /etoposide, 1200–2400 mg/m [2] /ifosfamide 0–
10 g/m [2] ) followed by either bone marrow or PBSC rescue,
mortality was 3% ( _n_ = 5 patients), with 3 patients dying from
severe renal toxicity (Beyer et al, 1997). Overall, acute nephrotoxicity occurred in 29% of patients, particularly at carboplatin >1500
mg/m [2] . Nephrotoxicity was defined as either a decline in the estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50% or as an absolute increase
of serum creatinine ≥ 1 mg dl [�][1] . Intermittent haemodialysis was
required in 8% of patients, and two patients entered chronic
haemodialysis. Nephrotoxicity resulted in an increased needs for
transfusions, more overall toxicity and a prolonged hospital stay.
Whereas the intensity of previous exposure to cisplatin has been
reported as a risk factor for nephrotoxicity from ifosfamide administration in children (Goren et al, 1987), Beyer and coworkers
were unable to identify any variables that might predict acute
nephrotoxicity after HD-CEI treatment. Two other reports that
studied HD-CEI in heterogeneous patient populations described
the frequency of acute nephrotoxicity as 46% and 29%, respectively (Wilson et al, 1992; Elias et al, 1995). Empiric dose reduction of HD-CEI has been suggested as soon as the deterioration of
renal function becomes apparent in order to prevent further renal
damage. The strategy of empiring dose reductions is important and
may save patients from irreversible side effects or even death, but,
it did not prevent the occurrence of acute nephrotoxicity in about
one third of patients. As an alternative method the a priori adjustment of the carboplatin dose according to the patients’ renal function has been used to achieve a predefined target area under the
curve for this drug (Calvert et al, 1989). However, the formula that
was devised by Calvert et al has only been established for singledosing and single-agent carboplatin administration. It does not
take into account the day to day changes that occur with combination chemotherapy including further potentially nephrotoxic drugs
and with repetitive dosing. In addition, no GFR-based formula for
dose calculations of etoposide and ifosfamide exists.
Renal insufficiency was also the dose-limiting toxicity of the
escalation of the HD-ICE regimen (Wright et al, 1995). Wright and
coworkers proposed a model of plasma drug level measurement
early during treatment to provide warning of renal failure. 9
patients received a 96 h infusion of ifosfamide (16 g/m [2] ), carboplatin (1.6 g/m [2] ) and etoposide (1.2 g/m [2] ). The drug levels and
plasma concentration–time curves of ifosfamide, ultrafiltrable
platinum and etoposide were analysed and correlated with renal
function. One of the 9 patients developed anuric renal failure
requiring haemodialysis. The authors conclude that high plasma
ifosfamide and ultrafiltrable platinum levels analysed early in the
course of the 96 h infusion of HD-ICE may provide a warning of
severe and potentially fatal renal injury.
Stomatitis with oesophagitis was common with HD-VIC (Elias
et al, 1995). Fields et al (1995) reported a high incidence of
enteritis, renal failure and veno-occlusive disease, as well as a
9% mortality. Siegert et al reported that at doses of carboplatin

1.5 g/m [2], etoposide 2.4 g/m [2] and ifosfamide 10 g/m [2] (HD-CEI)
WHO grade III/IV haematotoxicity occurred in 100%, nausea in
100% and diarrhoea in 30% and hepatotoxicity in 10% of patients.
All patients developed granulocytopenic fever. 3% of patients died
of treatment-related complications.
In our pilot study amifostine has also shown to significantly
ameloriate the gastrointestinal side effects of HD-VIC chemotherapy such as stomatitis, delayed nausea and vomiting, and
severe diarrhoea/enteritis. Acute nausea shortly after or during the
application of amifostine was a manageable therapeutic problem
with trifluorpromazine added prophylactically to a 5-HT3-receptor
antagonists plus dexamethasone. The reduced rate of delayed
nausea/vomiting and less stomatitis in the amifostine arm even
resulted in a lower rate of subsequently applied antiemetic medications and parenteral nutritions.
Amifostine has previously been demonstrated to reduce
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and cumulative bone marrow
toxicity of treatment with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and
cisplatin (Glover et al, 1986; Treskes et al, 1993; Budd et al, 1999).
In the current series with prophylactic application of G-CSF granulocyte engraftment occurred nearly at the same time in both treatment arms. Thrombocyte engraftment was observed earlier in the
amifostine arm compared to controls. The number of reinfused
PBSC was comparable between both arms excluding a possible
source of bias in this analysis. Even this moderately faster
haematopoietic recovery in the amifostine arm was associated with
a fewer number of days with fever > 38.5˚C and a lower requirement of i.v. antibiotics.

The calculation of treatment costs has become important in the
oncological setting, particularly when introducing drugs for
supportive care (Bennett et al, 1994, 1999; Glasziou and Mitchell,
1996; Fayers and Hand, 1999). Aspects of quality of life and
economics are nowadays established separate endpoints in cancer
trials. Agents that may result in acute and/or long-term benefits
should thus be evaluated in detail. We have provided a clinical
economic estimate of direct treatment costs during the in-patient
period in the HDCT-setting from a third party payer view. It was
not possible to consider treatment costs for possible long-term
toxicities and indirect non-medical costs in this analysis. The
reduction of HDCT-related acute toxicities by amifostine resulted
in lower costs for supportive care medication and an earlier
discharge of patients from the hospital. Savings of supportive care
costs in the amifostine arm were Euro 1243 per patient. Taking
into account the drug costs of amifostine (Euro 1783 per patient),
treatment with amifostine resulted in incremental costs of Euro

540 per patient. Similar to the use of G-CSF in adult patients with
acute myelogenous leukaemia with in-patient costs savings of US
$2300 (Bennett et al, 1999), previous pharmaeconomic reports
have indicated that amifostine has a favourable clinical and

cost–utility profile in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer
compared to other medical therapies such as autologous bone
marrow transplantation for relapsed Hodgkin’s disease or acute
non-lymphocytic leukaemia or adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal oestrogen receptor-negative women (Detsky and
Naglie, 1990).
In summary, the results from this randomized pilot study indicate that amifostine can ameloriate the acute side effects of HD
VIC chemotherapy with overall additional costs of approximately
Euro 550 per patient. Thus, a larger prospective trial needs to
address the definitive degree at which amifostine may increase the
safety of the widely used HDCT regimens based on carboplatin,

etoposide and ifosfamide and possibly other HDCT regimens.
Whether the reduction of the level of acute toxicity is transferred
into a lower degree of long-term toxicity and further costs savings
has to be determined in consecutive trials.
