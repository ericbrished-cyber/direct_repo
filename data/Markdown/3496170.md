Abstract

Learned irrelevance (LIrr) refers to a reduction in associative learning after pre-exposure of the
conditioned and unconditioned stimulus in a non-contingent fashion. This paradigm might serve as a
translational model for (pre)attentive information processing deﬁcits in schizophrenia. This is the ﬁrst
study to investigate the event-related potentials (ERPs) of a within-subject LIrr paradigm in humans.
Furthermore, the eﬀects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. As expected,
LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo
condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre-cued. This suggests that
the predictability of the occurrence of these stimuli is mainly reﬂected by this ERP component. Biperiden
had no eﬀect on the behavioural LIrr measures, although prolonged reaction times were evident.
Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre-exposed predictor letters, suggesting an eﬀect of this
drug on early perceptual processing. In conclusion, the within-subject paradigm used in the current
study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr. M1
antagonism did not aﬀect LIrr performance but seemed to inﬂuence early information processing.

Introduction

If a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned
stimulus (US) are repeatedly presented in a random,
uncorrelated manner, it is believed that an animal or
human learns that the occurrence of one stimulus
is irrelevant to the occurrence of the other one (e.g.
Baker, 1976; Mackintosh, 1973). Next, if the former
inconsequential CS becomes paired with the US, the
subsequent acquisition of the CS–US association is
delayed compared to stimuli that are novel. This
phenomenon, the retardation of associative CS–US
learning or classical conditioning after prior non-
contingent exposure
to the conditioning
stimuli,
is called learned irrelevance (LIrr; Gal et al. 2005).

Of note, presenting only the CS prior to subsequent
conditioning also induces a delay in CS–US learning
called latent inhibition (LI), which is viewed as being
closely related to LIrr (Allen et al. 2002).
In acute, ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia LIrr has been
found to be reduced or fully disrupted; the acquisition
of associations related to pre-exposed (PE) stimuli
occurs faster in this group of patients compared with
normal controls (Gal et al. 2005; Orosz et al. 2011;
Young et al. 2005). This means that LIrr is attenuated
or even absent and acute schizophrenics actually
outperform healthy individuals on these tasks. Fur-
thermore, in chronic schizophrenia patients a failure
to learn the CS–US association has been reported
(Gal et al. 2005; Young et al. 2005), indicative of a global
learning deﬁcit rather than impaired LIrr. High-risk
individuals (i.e. showing prodromal signs of psy-
chosis) and schizotypic people also show LIrr deﬁcits,
whereas asymptomatic ﬁrst-degree relatives of schizo-
phrenics are seemingly unaﬀected. Combined, these
ﬁndings are indicative of LIrr being a state marker for

The current study is the ﬁrst to assess the eﬀects of
the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden in healthy,
young volunteers using a within-subject LIrr para-
digm suitable for ERP measurement. We expected that
our LIrr paradigm would be successful in inducing
LIrr in the placebo condition. We expected that the
LIrr eﬀect would be disrupted after biperiden treat-
ment. With regard to the ERPs, we hypothesized that
the LIrr conditions would be most notably reﬂected in
the N1 and P3a/P3b. After biperiden, LIrr would be
disrupted as indicated by similar reaction times (RTs)
to PE-cued and non-pre-exposed (NPE)-cued targets
(i.e. no increase in RT due to pre-exposure). We ex-
pected that biperiden would most notably aﬀect the
N1 and P3a/P3b.

Methods

Participants

In total, 17 [seven male, 10 female; mean age 22.4 yr
(S.D.=3.0, range 19–29)] healthy volunteers were re-
cruited from Maastricht University through poster
advertisements. Participants were required to be aged
between 18 and 35 yr. We decided on a restricted
age range because EEG and ERPs can change with age
and can be diﬀerentially sensitive to cholinergic
modulation (Bennett et al. 2004; Fjell & Walhovd, 2004;
Pekkonen et al. 2005). Participants were also required
to have a body mass index of 18.5–30.0. They received
an extensive medical screening before testing, con-
sisting of a medical questionnaire, physical examin-
ation, measurement of blood pressure and pulse
rate, blood samples for haematology and biochemis-
try, urine samples for drug screen and pregnancy test
and a resting electrocardiogram. Exclusion criteria
were past or current psychiatric, neurological, cardiac,
gastrointestinal, haematological, hepatic, pulmonary
or renal illness, pregnancy, lactation, excessive alcohol
consumption (intake of >20 glasses/wk), use of any
medication other than oral contraceptives, having a
ﬁrst-degree relative with a current or past psychiatric
disorder and presence of other deﬁcits that could be
expected to inﬂuence performance. All subjects gave
a signed informed consent before inclusion and were
ﬁnancially rewarded for their participation. The study
was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of
Maastricht University.

psychosis but not a trait marker for a potential
schizophrenia endophenotype (Orosz et al. 2011).
There
is
a
great
lack
of
electrophysiological
[electroencephalography (EEG)] data on human LIrr,
although there are a few studies on event-related po-
tentials (ERPs) of LI (Guterman et al. 1996; Kathmann
et al. 2000). Therefore, the present study measured
EEG together with LIrr in healthy individuals; the
main focus was on the N1 and P3 ERPs. The N1 peak is
a negative component that occurs around 70–140 ms
post-stimulus at frontal and central electrode chan-
nels. This component seems to be related to the visual
properties of a stimulus but can be modulated by
selective attention. More speciﬁcally, its amplitude
has been shown to be larger (i.e. more negative) for
attended than for unattended or divided-attention
stimuli (Garcı´a-Larrea et al. 1992; Golob et al. 2002;
Jerger et al. 1992; Kho et al. 2003; Na¨a¨ta¨nen, 1990;
Rockstroh et al. 1996; White & Yee, 1997). The N1 is
also important for discrimination processes, as it is
absent if participants merely have to detect the pres-
ence of a stimulus (Mangun & Hillyard, 1991). As LIrr
might be interpreted as an attentional phenomenon
(Lubow, 2005), we decided to focus on the N1 com-
ponent in our analysis of the ERP data. The P3 peak is
a large positive-going waveform occurring about
250–500 ms post-stimulus. The P3 can be divided
into two subcomponents: an early occurring peak
in response
to novel
or alerting stimuli – called
the P3a – and a later component – dubbed the P3b –
which occurs in most tasks requiring a decision pro-
cess contingent on stimulus discrimination (Donchin,
1981).
There is a vast amount of literature on the role of
the dopaminergic and glutaminergic neurotransmitter
systems in schizophrenia. However, alterations of
muscarinic signalling also appear to underlie the
disorder (e.g. Brooks et al. 2011; Sarter et al. 2010;
Tandon et al. 1991, 1999). Post-mortem and in-vivo
imaging studies have shown a reduction of muscarinic
receptors density or binding in certain brain regions of
schizophrenia patients (but see Garcia-Rill et al. 1995;
Owen et al. 1981; Watanabe et al. 1983) and data seem
most consistent for the muscarinic M1 receptor sub-
type (Crook et al. 2000, 2001; Dean et al. 1996; Deng &
Huang, 2005; Newell et al. 2007; Scarr et al. 2008;
Zavitsanou et al. 2004; but see Dean et al. 2000; Scarr
et al. 2007). However, most of these binding studies
have used [3H]pirenzepine as a radioligand, which
also binds to the muscarinic M4 receptor subtype
(Barak, 2009). Thus, diﬀerentiating between the mus-
carinic M1 and M4 receptor is not possible on the basis
of these studies.

The study was conducted according to a double-
blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. In the
course of the week before the actual test sessions, the

eﬀects.
Subjects
were
not
allowed to use any psychoactive medication within
5 d before drug intake. Participants were asked to ab-
stain from alcohol on a testing day and 24 h before
testing. They were also not allowed to smoke and were
requested not to consume any caﬀeine-, teaine- or
aspartame-containing beverages on a testing day. The
participants were asked to ﬁll out some questionnaires
on mood and physical complaints (see below) 1 h be-
fore testing and were given a capsule containing
either a placebo, or 2 mg biperiden hydrochloride
(Akineton1, instant release; Laboratorio Farmaceutico
SIT S.r.l., Italy). They were provided with lunch
immediately afterwards: this was done in order to re-
duce the chances of participants developing any side-
eﬀects due to biperiden intake. Lunch consisted of a
can of caﬀeine-free soda, gluten-free bread and sweet
bread toppings. After drug intake EEG electrodes and
a cap were placed. After about 1 h of testing, the par-
ticipant had a short break, during which he or she was
asked to ﬁll out the same questionnaires again. The
test session ﬁnished about 3 h after drug intake. We
aimed to separate test sessions by about 7 d to ensure
suﬃcient washout of biperiden (average number of
washout days=9.3).

LIrr task

The within-subject LIrr paradigm was based on the
one developed by Young et al. (2005), which was fur-
ther modiﬁed by Gal et al. (2005) and Orosz et al. (2007,
2008, 2011). The paradigm was presented as a visual
target detection task using letter characters (see Fig. 1).
Capital Latin letters were shown successively on the
computer screen for 1 s each, with an inter-stimulus
interval of 1 s. The letters were font size 250, coloured
white [red, green, blue (RGB) colour model: 255-255-
255] on a black background (RGB: 0-0-0) and appeared
in the centre of the monitor. The participants were in-
structed to press the spacebar as soon as the target
letter ‘X’ appeared on screen. In addition to the target,
there were 10 other consonants and vowels presented
during a single version of the task. These letters could
either be preceding the ‘X’ – called predictor letters –
or ﬁll in the spaces between the predictor–target

Biperiden is a muscarinic M1 antagonist approved for
the treatment of Parkinson symptoms, which develop
due to use of ﬁrst-generation antipsychotics (e.g.
Ogino et al. 2011). It has about 10-fold higher aﬃnity
for M1 as compared with M2–M5 receptors and is thus
the most selective M1 antagonist available for use in
human participants (Bolden et al. 1992; Katayama et al.
1990). Peak plasma concentrations are reached around
1–2 h after a single dose administration followed by a
rapid initial decline to around 12% of the peak values
at 6 h after intake. This is subsequently followed by a
slow terminal elimination phase at 48 h (Hollman et al.
1984, 1987). The most common side-eﬀects of bi-
periden on the central nervous system are drowsiness,
vertigo, headache and dizziness. Peripheral side-
eﬀects consist of blurred vision, mydriasis, dry mouth,
impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort and ob-
stipation (e.g. Mintzer & Burns, 2000; Peters, 1989;
Tune et al. 1992). We chose a dose of 2 mg as this
lies well within the range of the therapeutically
recommended
doses
for
biperiden
(1–4 mg).
Moreover, oral treatment with 2 mg biperiden has
been shown to impair cognitive performance in
healthy elderly individuals (Wezenberg et al. 2005).

combinations – called ﬁller letters. During one test
session, 375 non-target and 75 target letters were
presented, which means that the test duration was
approximately 15 min. The subjects were presented
with a series of 15 blocks of 30 letters each. The blocks
were divided into three diﬀerent conditions (with each
block/condition presented ﬁve times):

Mood Scale (Bond & Lader, 1974), which has 16
visual analogue scales that yield three mood factors:
contented–discontented; alert–drowsy; calm–excited.
For the POMS and Bond & Lader questionnaires, a
diﬀerence score of mean scoreT1 (1 h after drug in-
take) – mean scoreT0 (baseline, before drug intake) was
calculated and used for analysis. Physical or mental
complaints were assessed with a self-report question-
naire consisting of 31 possible complaints to be rated on
a 4-point scale.

EEG and ERPs

(1) NPE blocks – In NPE blocks the target ‘X’ was
always predicted by the same letter, which was
completely novel. Each NPE letter acted as a target
predictor in one particular NPE block and was not
presented before or in later test sessions. Thus,
NPE cues reliably predicted the target and enabled
full prediction of it.
(2) PE blocks – In a PE block the target was preceded
ﬁve times by the same letter. However, this PE
predictor letter had already been shown in pre-
vious blocks as a ﬁller letter (i.e. uncorrelated to
the target letter). In other words, whereas NPE
predictors were completely novel, PE predictors
were not. Therefore, prediction of the occurrence of
the letter ‘X’ was partial in this condition.
(3) Random (RAN) blocks – Targets appeared ran-
domly after diﬀerent consonants or vowels, which
also served as PE and ﬁller letters. Prediction of the
target letter was therefore zero in the RAN blocks.

According to the degree of prediction, the RT to target
was expected to be the lowest for the NPE-, somewhat
higher for the PE- and the highest for the RAN-cued
targets. In cases of LIrr, the average RT to PE-cued
targets is supposed to be signiﬁcantly higher than in
that of NPE-cued targets (RTPE>RTNPE, see Orosz et al.
2008). Our main outcome variables were RT (ms) to
the target and a LIrr index, which was calculated as
follows:
(RTPE/RTRAN) – (RTNPE/RTRAN).
A
score
greater than zero would be indicative of intact LIrr
(Gal et al. 2005). In order to monitor whether partici-
pants had understood the instructions and were well
motivated to perform the LIrr task, we also measured
number of hits (actual target response), misses (failure
of target response), false alarms (response to ﬁller
letters) and premature responses (response to pre-
dictors).

Questionnaires

For the EEG recording, the Neuroscan Synamps sys-
tem (Neuroscan, USA) was used with sample rate set
at 1000 Hz. Data were ﬁltered between 0.05–100 Hz.
EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes placed on the
scalp using an elastic cap (Electro-Cap International,
USA) and positioned according to the 10–20 system
(Jasper, 1958). The horizontal electro-oculogram was
measured with two electrodes placed on the outer
canthus of the left and right eye and two electrodes
placed below and above the centre of the left eye re-
corded the vertical electro-oculogram (VEOG). Two
electrodes behind the ears served as reference electro-
des. Before placing the electrodes, all locations were
cleaned with alcohol and gently scrubbed with a gel,
to ensure good conduction of the signal. Impedance
was kept <5 V. During the EEG recordings, the par-
ticipants were sitting in an electrically shielded and
sound-attenuated room with the lights dimmed.
All EEG data were analysed with Vision Analyzer
2.0. Before data analysis, the EEG data were visually
inspected oﬄine, to check for artefacts. The EEG signal
was ﬁltered with a high pass ﬁlter set at 1 Hz (12 dB
slope) and a low pass ﬁlter set at 30 Hz (12 dB slope).
The ERP epochs were set from 100 ms prior to stimu-
lus onset to 900 ms after onset, using the 100 ms pre-
stimulus as baseline. Eye movement artefacts were
ﬁltered out of the EEG using the data of the VEOG
channel and the method developed by Semlitsch et al.
(1986). In this way, every participant had about the
same number of artefact-free trials, which were com-
bined into the ERP averages. Separate averages were
calculated for the predictors and the targets, as well as
for the NPE, PE and RAN stimuli. For the predictor
stimuli, N1 and P3a peaks were noted on the Fz, FCz
and Cz channels. In the case of the targets, N1 and P3b
peaks could be distinguished on the CPz, CP3, CP4,
Pz, P3 and P4 electrodes. Please refer to Table 1 for
the time windows chosen for ERP peak detection
analysis. Peak windows were determined based on the
grand averages. Peak amplitudes were calculated and

To assess subjective mood changes, the Proﬁle of Mood
States (POMS) was used (McNair et al. 1971). This self-
report questionnaire has 32 visual analogue scales,
which measure the mood states tension–anxiety,
depression–dejection, anger–hostility, fatigue–inertia
and vigour–activity. We also used the Bond and Lader

Statistical analysis

One participant did not meet the requirement of at
least 80% target hits and was therefore excluded from
behavioural and ERP analysis. Part of the behavioural
data was missing for another subject; this person was
also not included, leaving a total of 15 participants.

Behavioural data: LIrr eﬀects

Figure 2 shows the eﬀects of the LIrr conditions on
RT to the target letters. In the analysis of the RT
data, there was a main eﬀect of LIrr condition on RT
[F(2, 28)=21.73, p<0.001]. Post-hoc analysis showed
that RTs to the target letters were faster for the NPE
compared with the RAN (p<0.001) and PE condition
(p<0.001).

ERP data: LIrr eﬀects on predictor and target letters

In the placebo analyses of the predictor letters, there
were no relevant task eﬀects on N1 amplitude and la-
tency (F’s<1.69, n.s.) or P3a amplitude and latency
(F’s<2.50, n.s.). In the placebo analyses of the target
letters, there were no relevant task eﬀects on N1 am-
plitude and latency (F’s<1.58, n.s.) or on P3b ampli-
tude (F’s<1.17, n.s.). The eﬀect of LIrr condition
on P3b latency did not vary per level of electrode

eﬀects:
F(10 130)=0.44, n.s.], yet P3b latency was found to
diﬀer between LIrr conditions [main eﬀect of LIrr
condition: F(2, 26)=11.99, p<0.001]; post-hoc analysis
showed that the P3b latency of NPE-cued targets
occurred earlier compared with the P3b latency of
RAN-cued (p<0.001) and PE-cued targets (p<0.05).
Figure 3 shows the eﬀects of the LIrr conditions on the
P3b component of the target letters in the placebo
condition.

Behavioural data: eﬀect of biperiden

Only participants who had at least 80% target hits, i.e.
60 of the total of 75, were included in the behavioural
and ERP analyses. This criterion was used to ensure
that all participants understood and were able to fol-
low the instructions. Statistical data were analysed
using SPSS. For all analyses, signiﬁcant interactions
were examined in more detail by doing additional
analyses of variance (ANOVAs) split for each level of
one of the interaction variables. Post-hoc testing was
performed with a least signiﬁcant diﬀerence post-hoc
test. For both the behavioural and ERP data, the ﬁrst
trial of a block was always excluded from analysis
under the assumption that implicit associative learn-
ing will need at least one CS–US or predictor-target
pairing in order to be expressed. Subsequently, beha-
vioural and ERP data were collapsed across blocks.
To determine possible treatment eﬀects on the LIrr
index, behavioural data were analysed by parametric
ANOVA (repeated measures ANOVA) with drug
(two levels: placebo and biperiden) as within-subject
variable. For the analyses of the RT data, LIrr con-
dition (three levels: RAN, PE and NPE) was added as
an additional within-subject variable. We then evalu-
ated whether the LIrr conditions had a diﬀerential
eﬀect on the ERPs. Therefore, the placebo data were
analysed using repeated measures ANOVAs with LIrr
condition (three levels: RAN, PE and NPE) and elec-
trode (three levels for predictors: Fz, FCz and Cz, two
levels for targets: CPz, Pz). We determined the eﬀects
of biperiden on the processing of predictor and
target letters by doing the same analyses with drug
(two levels: placebo and biperiden) as an extra within-
subject variable. ERP analyses were done separately
for amplitude and latency, stimulus type (i.e. pre-
dictors and targets) and each of the ERP peaks.
Questionnaire data were analysed with paired
samples t tests separately for each subscale. The POMS
had ﬁve subscales, whereas for the Bond & Lader we

Discussion

humans (Gal et al. 2005; Orosz et al. 2007, 2008, 2011;
Young et al. 2005). Moreover, our results are also in
line with studies investigating the facilitating eﬀect of
stimulus predictability on RT (Barcelo & Knight, 2007;
Fogelson et al. 2008; Suwazono et al. 2000). The LIrr
index in our experiment was 0.2 after placebo, which
is well over zero and therefore indicative of a robust
LIrr eﬀect of our task. In comparison, the LIrr index
reported by Gal et al. (2005) in his group of healthy
normal controls was about 0.1.
The three LIrr conditions (RAN, PE and NPE) af-
fected P3b latency (but not amplitude) of the target
letters as a function of the participant’s degree of un-
certainty about the occurrence of the target letter ‘X’
(see Fig. 3). The P3b occurred earliest after presen-
tation of NPE-cued targets (averaged over all electrode
channels), relatively later for PE-cued targets and was
the slowest to occur for the RAN-cued targets. P3b
latency is usually interpreted as an indication of
stimulus evaluation speed, with shorter latencies in-
dicative of superior cognitive performance (Polich &
Criado, 2006). The traditional view states that the P3b
starts to occur when stimulus evaluation processes are
completed (Sutton et al. 1965, 1967). The ﬁnding that
the P3b latency of a target stimulus is shortened by a
predictor stimulus signalling subsequent target pres-
entation is supported by evidence of earlier studies
(Duncan-Johnson & Donchin, 1977, 1980; Fogelson
et al. 2008), which showed that P3b latency is de-
creased for targets that are considered highly probable
than those that are less probable. Furthermore, as
already suggested by Fogelson et al. (2008), the en-
hancement of stimulus evaluation speed of predictable
targets appears to be cognitive rather than perceptual.
Our target stimuli were always similar (i.e. throughout
the task the target stimulus was the letter X) and there
was no inﬂuence of LIrr conditions on early perceptual
ERP components (e.g. N1). In line with our ﬁndings,
previous studies utilizing discrimination tasks in
which participants are instructed to favour accuracy
over speed have shown a positive correlation between
P3b latency and RT performance (Kutas et al. 1977;
but see Verleger, 1997). Taken together, the eﬀects of
the LIrr conditions on P3b but not N1 latency suggest
that LIrr is more related to stimulus evaluation pro-
cesses rather than early perceptual/attentional mech-
anisms.
A behavioural disruption of LIrr after biperiden
treatment was expected to be reﬂected by similar RTs
to NPE-cued and PE-cued targets (i.e. no increase in
RT due to pre-exposure). However, biperiden did
not aﬀect LIrr as participants still showed faster RTs
to NPE-cued as opposed to PE-cued target letters

The goal of the current study was to develop a LIrr
task suitable for ERP measurement and to examine the
eﬀects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on
behavioural performance and ERP correlates of LIrr in
healthy young volunteers. The LIrr paradigm used
in our current study was successful in inducing LIrr in
healthy, young volunteers who received placebo
medication (see Figs 2 and 4). For the behavioural re-
sults, LIrr was reﬂected in shorter RTs in relation to
the degree of target predictability: fastest to NPE-cued
targets, which were fully predictable, slower to PE-
cued targets, which were partially predictable and
slowest for RAN-cued targets, which yielded zero
prediction. These ﬁndings are in accordance with
earlier reports using within-subject LIrr-paradigms in

amplitudes and/or increased latencies of the N1, P3a
or P3b peaks after biperiden. It is unclear whether the
biperiden-induced increment in N1 amplitude reﬂects
cognitive/central or non-cognitive/peripheral pro-
cesses. Biperiden has been known to cause blurred
vision in healthy volunteers (e.g. Fleischhacker et al.
1987); however, impaired vision would be expected
to reduce N1 amplitude rather than increase it. More-
over, our participants did not report visual impair-
ments after biperiden compared to placebo. Third,
blurred vision would be likely to globally inﬂuence N1
amplitude; that is, the N1 amplitude of RAN and NPE
predictor letters would also be aﬀected and not only
that of the PE predictors. The only non-cognitive eﬀect
of biperiden we did ﬁnd was a general slowing of
psychomotor performance (see above). However, re-
sponding to a target stimulus takes place much later
after presentation of that stimulus, whereas the N1 is
an early perceptual component that is regarded as
separate from response behaviour (Na¨a¨ta¨nen et al.
1988).
A cognitive explanation of the increment in N1
amplitude of PE predictor letters after biperiden in-
take is also not very straightforward. Given the ﬁnding
that N1 amplitudes are larger for attended than for
unattended stimuli (e.g. Haider et al. 1964), a drug that
is known to disrupt cognition would be expected
to reduce N1 amplitude rather than increase it. It might
be the case that, after biperiden, there is an over-
compensation of the irrelevant-to-relevant switch or,
in other words, participants needed to allocate more
attentional resources in order to successfully link the
presentation of the previously irrelevant PE predictor
with the subsequent occurrence of the target letter.
Taken together, our results would argue for an atten-
tional eﬀect of biperiden.

(see Fig. 2). Similarly, the LIrr index was not reduced
(see Fig. 4) and participants did not report any side-
eﬀects on our questionnaires after biperiden. The only
discernible eﬀect of biperiden was an overall increase
in RT. In line with our results, Wezenberg et al. (2005)
reported a dose of 2 mg biperiden to increase move-
ment time in a motor learning task. However, the au-
thors interpreted this eﬀect as being due to attentional
deﬁcits, rather than a general slowing of psychomotor
performance.
Several studies have reported a detrimental eﬀect
of biperiden on memory processes. In the study of
Guthrie et al. (2000), impairments were found in
backward but not forward digit span. Both of these
tasks are thought to tap into several cognitive pro-
cesses, among which are memory and attention
(Larrabee & Kane, 1986). In the same study, biperiden
also aﬀected verbal memory; on a selective reminding
task participants recalled fewer words at both im-
mediate and delayed recall. These results were re-
plicated and extended by Wezenberg et al. (2005).
These studies thus provide support for the view that
the muscarinic M1 receptor is important for memory
functions. Theories about LIrr have focused on beha-
vioural switching (Weiner, 2003), attention (Lubow,
2005; Schmajuk, 2005) and inhibition of redundant
stimuli (Gluck & Myers, 1993). Hence, LIrr is thought
of as a paradigm that measures attentional rather
than mnemonic abilities, which might explain why a
memory-impairing drug such as biperiden failed to
have an eﬀect on our LIrr task.
Biperiden also increased the amplitude of the N1
component of the PE predictor letters – which were
previously irrelevant but later on became partial pre-
dictors of the target stimulus (see Fig. 5). This was an
unsuspected ﬁnding given our hypothesis of reduced

Interestingly, a study examining LI and ERPs in
acute and stable, partially remitted schizophrenia
patients and healthy controls reported results that
were comparable to our own (Kathmann et al. 2000).
All participants exhibited robust LI; in other words,
schizophrenics were not impaired in this regard.
Schizophrenic patients did show slower RTs com-
pared with the normal, healthy controls, which is in
accordance with our biperiden data. In contrast to the
behavioural results, the electrophysiological data did
diﬀerentiate between diagnostic groups. Pre-exposure
aﬀected the N1 amplitudes to CS+ stimuli, which
were irrelevant during pre-exposure but subsequently
served as predictors during acquisition. Thus, these
stimuli were conceptually similar to our PE predictor
letters. Speciﬁcally, N1 amplitudes of CS+ stimuli
were decreased in healthy controls, increased in acute
schizophrenics and unchanged in partially remitted
schizophrenics after pre-exposure. The authors inter-
preted this ﬁnding as an enhancement of allocation of
attention to previously irrelevant stimuli or, alterna-
tively, as a failure to inhibit previously irrelevant
stimuli from gaining access to attentional processing
in the acute schizophrenic patient group. Of note, all
patients
received
neuroleptic
medication,
which
means that an eﬀect of these drugs on ERPs cannot be
excluded.
In sum, our LIrr paradigm induced robust LIrr in
healthy young volunteers. As for the ERP results, LIrr
was reﬂected in shorter P3b latency (i.e. faster stimulus
evaluation processing) in relation to the degree of tar-
get predictability. LIrr was not aﬀected after biperiden,
but the N1 amplitude of the PE predictor letters was
increased (suggestive of increased allocation of atten-
tional/behavioural switching resources). The present
data are inconclusive as to the attentional or mnemonic
eﬀects of biperiden, although the ERP data suggest
a role in early information processing. Changes in
LIrr after drug intake might ultimately serve as a
psychopharmacological model for neuropsychiatric
disorders, such as schizophrenia. For translational
purposes, it would be pertinent to also determine
drug-induced alterations in ERP correlates of LIrr.
